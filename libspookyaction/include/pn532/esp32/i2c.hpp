     *
     * This class supports, when specified, the possibility of using a GPIO pin for the PN532's IRQ line; in that case, the
     * class does not have to poll the controller until the answers are ready, but it will instead idle and wait for the IRQ
     * line to become active, and read the answer only then once it's ready. That is done through a semaphore and an interrupt
     * installed on the GPIO.
     * @warning Due to ESP32's "buffered" type of I2C commands, it is not possible to easily read variable length data. This
     *  channel is relatively slow because in order to read a full PN532 packet, it has to issue several I2C commands. The
     *  reason is that we need to build the I2C command in beforehand, so we need to know already the read length. To work
     *  around this limitation, we request the packet several times using an PN532-level NACK message until we have enough
     *  information to read the full extent of the message. Attempts at "tricking" the ESP32's driver by not issuing the
     *  necessary stop failed, as they put the PN532 in an invalid state.
