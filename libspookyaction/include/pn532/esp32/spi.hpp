     * @brief Implementation of SPI channel protocol for PN532 over ESP32's SPI driver (UM0701-02 ยง6.2.5).
     *
     * This class supports, when specified, the possibility of using a GPIO pin for the PN532's IRQ line; in that case, the
     * class does not have to poll the controller until the answers are ready, but it will instead idle and wait for the IRQ
     * line to become active, and read the answer only then once it's ready. That is done through a semaphore and an interrupt
     * installed on the GPIO.
     * @warning Experiments have shown that the SPI channel is often unstable, especially at high clocks (> 1MHz). It is not
     *  clear why this occurs, but it looks like at high speeds it fails when transmitting extended info frames. Even at low
     *  speeds, it seldom fails after long exchanges. The PN532 enters an invalid state in which it never returns an answer.
     *  Therefore it's recommended to stay within 1MHz of speed.
     * @note This class supports a "stream-like" usage, i.e. it can progressively read pieces of an incoming info frame in order
     *  to determine its length. To achieve that, it is stateful (during a receive operation), as any receive operation other
     *  than the first has to omit specifying the data read prefix.
